# Root Access

Root Access is a single-player action-platformer metroidvania where two scientists navigate a corrupted forest and ascend a failing radio tower. The player swaps quickly between **Olivia’s tech-focused utility** and **Eli’s acrobatic traversal abilities** to investigate and ultimately stop the spread of strange anomalies. This game is being developed alongside participation in the IGA Level 2 Course, cohort 11.

- **Genre:** 2D action-platformer / metroidvania  
- **Core Fantasy:** You are a two-person team, cutting through obstacles using brains, agility, and improvisation to stop the impending apocalypse.  
- **Gameplay Hook:** Fast, fluid **character swapping** where each protagonist has distinct abilities and ability progression.

## Aesthetic & Tone

- **Art Style**
  - Pixel art with a blend of:
    - **Sci-fi:** terminals, panels, cables, antennae.
    - **Solar punk:** hopeful, green tech and sustainable design.
    - **Naturalistic forest elements:** roots, overgrowth, organic shapes reclaiming infrastructure.

- **Tone**
  - Generally **light-hearted and character-driven**, with:
    - Playful exchanges and personality in moment-to-moment play.
    - A more serious emotional thread underneath, focused on the partnership between the two protagonists.

## 🔊 Audio Collaboration

> This section is especially for SFCM students partnering with the IGA Level 2 course.

### Current Audio Direction Status

I do not have a locked-in audio direction yet, which means there is creative space for an audio collaborator to help shape the identity of Root Access from an early stage. Rather than prescribing a rigid style, the goal is to build the audio direction together around the duality of tech vs. nature, the relationship between Olivia & Eli, alongside the core themes of the prompt: love, danger, science, and anomalies.
- The contrast between **surface forest**, **tower interior**, and **anomaly-heavy zones**

### Initial Audio Thoughts

  - I'd like to reinforce the following concepts gleaned from the prompt:
    - The **hopeful, solar-punk** aspects of the world.
    - The **mystery and unease** of the anomalies.
    - The evolving **trust and strain** in Olivia and Eli’s partnership.
  - Potential directions (open for interpretation):
    - Organic + synthetic blends (e.g., warm pads + acoustic textures).
    - Light rhythmic drive to support movement and platforming flow.


## Development Status & Goals

- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Platform (current target):** PC (Windows)  
- **Focus for the Course:**
  - Building a small but polished vertical slice that highlights the core game features.
  - Developing a cohesive art + design + audio experience, even if limted.
