# Root Access

Root Access is a single-player action-platformer metroidvania where two scientists navigate a corrupted forest and ascend a failing radio tower. The player swaps quickly between **Olivia’s tech-focused utility** and **Eli’s acrobatic traversal abilities** to investigate and ultimately stop the spread of strange anomalies. This game is being developed alongside participation in the IGA Level 2 Course, cohort 11.

- **Genre:** 2D action-platformer / metroidvania  
- **Core Fantasy:** You are a two-person team, cutting through obstacles using brains, agility, and improvisation to stop the impending apocalypse.  
- **Gameplay Hook:** Fast, fluid **character swapping** where each protagonist has distinct abilities and ability progression.

## Audio Collaboration

> This section is especially for SFCM students partnering with the IGA Level 2 course.

### Current Audio Direction Status

I do not have a locked-in audio direction yet, which means there is creative space for an audio collaborator to help shape the identity of Root Access from an early stage. Rather than prescribing a rigid style, the goal is to build the audio direction together around the duality of tech vs. nature, the relationship between Olivia & Eli, alongside the core themes of the prompt: love, danger, science, and anomalies.
